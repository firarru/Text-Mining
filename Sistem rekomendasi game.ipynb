You'll find yourself investigating in-game & online, using the web and interacting with websites, companies and NPCs we have created. Warning: If this is your first Alternate Reality Game, please take the time to try the demo. The Black Watchmen is unlike any other game on Steam. You will have the opportunity to complete tasks unique to PARGs. You must be prepared: There is no virtual world, and you have no in-game avatar. You have an agent name, and the whole web to investigate for NPCs, fake websites and stories that blend the real word with our fiction. Several times during missions, you will be interacting with real world entities (players, businesses, organizations, etc.). You will not be able to complete this game alone. Only with the help of the community will you be able to rise through the ranks, and become a veteran agent of The Black Watchmen. The World of The Black Watchmen The Black Watchmen are a paramilitary group dedicated to protecting the public from dangerous phenomena beyond human understanding: ritualistic murder, occult secret societies, and paranormal activity, to name but a few. As a global organization, The Black Watchmen offer a wide range of skills and services for covert missions anywhere in the world, on behalf of any group, corporation or government that can afford them. Often called in as a last resort, The Black Watchmen pride themselves on their discretion, strength and efficiency. To maintain objectivity in the field, you, as an agent, are never informed of the identity of the client. You are given only mission parameters and told how to distinguish friend from foe, but the lines are often blurred\\u2026 Gameplay Features Gameplay: Different missions require different skill-sets. Crack ancient codes and investigate bizarre occurrences Join a squadron of soldiers raiding a rupture site Hack through the virtual defenses of your enemies Research an occult group and uncover hidden connections All Around You: The game is played using coded websites, wikis and real world references. Mission Hub: An interface that acts as a hub for information, mission briefings, puzzles, and more. Agent Map: See the locations of your fellow agents around the world, and keep an eye out for potential location-based missions. \",\n          \" About This Content You will obtain the following items: Wall Nut x1 Coco Palm x1 Mangoh x1 Dragon Fruit x1\",\n          \" About This Game Happy words is a word based real time online multiplayer board game for 1 to 4 players in which you have to create new words based on existing ones.

Paulo Brunassi - NukGames\",\n          \" About This Software Groupy is a killer app that will let you take things like Microsoft Office programs, Adobe Creative Suite apps, File Explorer windows, and much more, and put them into tabbed groups. Just like modern web browsers group their websites together, you can now do that with all of the Windows apps on your desktop, making for a cleaner and more efficient experience. Creating groups is simple: drag a window to another window and combine them into a single window, with tabs showing in the title bar. For example, open multiple web browsers, all in one set of tabs, or Office applications like Excel and Word, all in a single, easy-to-use window. To ungroup, simply drag the tab off the group. Save existing groups and launch them at a later time, contained and ready to go. Once a group is created, you can quickly switch between different windows with a simple hot-key or by clicking on the tab. Groupy can also automatically add launched programs into an existing tabbed group. Groupy works on Windows 10, 8, and 7. Features Drag and drop applications together to group them under a common tabbed interface Organize multiple applications and documents together for convenient access Group related tabs together for optimal workflow Save groups of applications together for future usage Manage tabs in quick and natural ways with the browser-like interface Add new tabs to existing groups quickly and easily Mouseover tabs to preview the window contents Copy files between Explorer tabs. Drag files to the target tab, pause to switch, and then into the target window.

Featues: - 2 Card Themes - Draw 1 card (Easy) - Draw 3 cards (Hard) - Time/Moves show your progress - Standard Scoring Rules - Unlimited Undos - Unlimited Hints - Tap or Drag cards Rules Many Solitaire games can be played on areas smaller than a card table. Others require a larger playing area, and these games are often played on the floor or on a bedspread. Alternatively, in order to play with large layouts on a card table, miniature playing cards are available. These are usually half the size of standard playing cards. The Pack Virtually all Solitaire games are played with one or more standard 52-card packs. Standard Solitaire uses one 52-card pack. Object of the Game The first objective is to release and play into position certain cards to build up each foundation, in sequence and in suit, from the ace through the king. The ultimate objective is to build the whole pack onto the foundations, and if that can be done, the Solitaire game is won. Rank of Cards The rank of cards in Solitaire games is: K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low). The Deal There are four different types of piles in Solitaire: The Tableau: Seven piles that make up the main table. The Foundations: Four piles on which a whole suit or sequence must be built up. In most Solitaire games, the four aces are the bottom card or base of the foundations. The foundation piles are hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. The Stock (or \\u201cHand\\u201d) Pile: If the entire pack is not laid out in a tableau at the beginning of a game, the remaining cards form the stock pile from which additional cards are brought into play according to the rules. The Talon (or \\u201cWaste\\u201d) Pile: Cards from the stock pile that have no place in the tableau or on foundations are laid face up in the waste pile. To form the tableau, seven piles need to be created. Starting from left to right, place the first card face up to make the first pile, deal one card face down for the next six piles. Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the second pile and deal one card face down on piles three through seven. Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the third pile and deal one card face down on piles four through seven. Continue this pattern until pile seven has one card facing up on top of a pile of six cards facing down. The remaining cards form the stock (or \\u201chand\\u201d) pile and are placed above the tableau. When starting out, the foundations and waste pile do not have any cards. The Play The initial array may be changed by \\\"building\\\" - transferring cards among the face-up cards in the tableau. Certain cards of the tableau can be played at once, while others may not be played until certain blocking cards are removed. For example, of the seven cards facing up in the tableau, if one is a nine and another is a ten, you may transfer the nine to on top of the ten to begin building that pile in sequence. Since you have moved the nine from one of the seven piles, you have now unblocked a face down card; this card can be turned over and now is in play. As you transfer cards in the tableau and begin building sequences, if you uncover an ace, the ace should be placed in one of the foundation piles. The foundations get built by suit and in sequence from ace to king. Continue to transfer cards on top of each other in the tableau in sequence. If you can\\u2019t move any more face up cards, you can utilize the stock pile by flipping over the first card. This card can be played in the foundations or tableau. If you cannot play the card in the tableau or the foundations piles, move the card to the waste pile and turn over another card in the stock pile. If a vacancy in the tableau is created by the removal of cards elsewhere it is called a \\u201cspace\\u201d, and it is of major importance in manipulating the tableau. If a space is created, it can only be filled in with a king. Filling a space with a king could potentially unblock one of the face down cards in another pile in the tableau. Continue to transfer cards in the tableau and bring cards into play from the stock pile until all the cards are built in suit sequences in the foundation piles to win! Info Patience, or solitaire as it is known in the US and Canada, is a genre of card games that can be played by a single player. Patience games can also be played in a head-to-head fashion with the winner selected by a scoring scheme. In the US, the term solitaire is often used specifically to refer to solitaire with cards, while in other countries solitaire specifically refers to peg solitaire. Both Solitaire and Patience are sometimes used to refer specifically to the Klondike form of Patience. The purpose of Patience generally involves manipulating a layout of cards with a goal of sorting them in some manner. It is possible to play the same games competitively (often a head to head race) and cooperatively. Patience games typically involve dealing cards from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on a tabletop, from which the player attempts to reorder the deck by suit and rank through a series of moves transferring cards from one place to another under prescribed restrictions. Some games allow for the reshuffling of the deck(s), and/or the placement of cards into new or \\\"empty\\\" locations. In the most familiar, general form of Patience, the object of the game is to build up four blocks of cards going from ace to king in each suit, taking cards from the layout if they appear on the table. There is a vast array of variations on the patience theme, using either one or more decks of cards, with rules of varying complexity and skill levels. Many of these have been converted to electronic form and are available as computer games. Examples of variants on the familiar Patience theme that may be played with an ordinary pack of cards include Bisley and Prince Albert. Basic forms of Klondike solitaire and FreeCell come with every version of Microsoft Windows from Windows 3.0 (though FreeCell was introduced in Windows 95) to Windows 7. Ever since the release of Windows 8, Windows Store offers six unique card games which can be downloaded for free from in the form of the Collection. There are also many applications for Android and iOS. History The game is most likely German or Scandinavian in origin.[1] The game became popular in France in the early 19th Century reaching England and America in the latter half. The earliest known recording of a game of patience occurred in 1783 in the German game anthology Das neue K\\u00f6nigliche L'Hombre-Spiel. Before this, there were no literary mentions of such games in large game compendiums such as Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester (1674) and Abb\\u00e9 Bellecour's Academie des Jeux (1674). Patience was first mentioned in literature shortly after cartomantic layouts were developed circa 1765, suggesting a connection between the two. This theory is supported by the name of the game in Danish and Norwegian, kabal(e). An 1895 account describes a variant of the game exclusively used for cartomancy.[1] The first collection of patience card games in the English language is attributed to Lady Adelaide Cadogan through her Illustrated Games of Patience, published in about 1870 and reprinted several times. Other collections quickly followed such as Patience by E. D. Cheney (1869), Amusement for Invalids by Annie B. Henshaw (1870), and later Dick's Games of Patience, published by Dick and Fitzgerald. Other books about patience written towards the end of the 19th century were by H. E. Jones (a.k.a. Cavendish), Angelo Lewis (a.k.a. Professor Hoffman), Basil Dalton, Ernest Bergholt, and Mary Whitmore Jones.

Others require a larger playing area, and these games are often played on the floor or on a bedspread. Alternatively, in order to play with large layouts on a card table, miniature playing cards are available. These are usually half the size of standard playing cards. The Pack Virtually all Solitaire games are played with one or more standard 52-card packs. Standard Solitaire uses one 52-card pack. Object of the Game The first objective is to release and play into position certain cards to build up each foundation, in sequence and in suit, from the ace through the king. The ultimate objective is to build the whole pack onto the foundations, and if that can be done, the Solitaire game is won. Rank of Cards The rank of cards in Solitaire games is: K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low). The Deal There are four different types of piles in Solitaire: The Tableau: Seven piles that make up the main table. The Foundations: Four piles on which a whole suit or sequence must be built up. In most Solitaire games, the four aces are the bottom card or base of the foundations. The foundation piles are hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. The Stock (or \\u201cHand\\u201d) Pile: If the entire pack is not laid out in a tableau at the beginning of a game, the remaining cards form the stock pile from which additional cards are brought into play according to the rules. The Talon (or \\u201cWaste\\u201d) Pile: Cards from the stock pile that have no place in the tableau or on foundations are laid face up in the waste pile. To form the tableau, seven piles need to be created. Starting from left to right, place the first card face up to make the first pile, deal one card face down for the next six piles. Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the second pile and deal one card face down on piles three through seven. Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the third pile and deal one card face down on piles four through seven. Continue this pattern until pile seven has one card facing up on top of a pile of six cards facing down. The remaining cards form the stock (or \\u201chand\\u201d) pile and are placed above the tableau. When starting out, the foundations and waste pile do not have any cards. The Play The initial array may be changed by \\\"building\\\" - transferring cards among the face-up cards in the tableau. Certain cards of the tableau can be played at once, while others may not be played until certain blocking cards are removed. For example, of the seven cards facing up in the tableau, if one is a nine and another is a ten, you may transfer the nine to on top of the ten to begin building that pile in sequence. Since you have moved the nine from one of the seven piles, you have now unblocked a face down card; this card can be turned over and now is in play. As you transfer cards in the tableau and begin building sequences, if you uncover an ace, the ace should be placed in one of the foundation piles. The foundations get built by suit and in sequence from ace to king. Continue to transfer cards on top of each other in the tableau in sequence. If you can\\u2019t move any more face up cards, you can utilize the stock pile by flipping over the first card. This card can be played in the foundations or tableau. If you cannot play the card in the tableau or the foundations piles, move the card to the waste pile and turn over another card in the stock pile. If a vacancy in the tableau is created by the removal of cards elsewhere it is called a \\u201cspace\\u201d, and it is of major importance in manipulating the tableau. If a space is created, it can only be filled in with a king. Filling a space with a king could potentially unblock one of the face down cards in another pile in the tableau. Continue to transfer cards in the tableau and bring cards into play from the stock pile until all the cards are built in suit sequences in the foundation piles to win! Info Patience, or solitaire as it is known in the US and Canada, is a genre of card games that can be played by a single player. Patience games can also be played in a head-to-head fashion with the winner selected by a scoring scheme. In the US, the term solitaire is often used specifically to refer to solitaire with cards, while in other countries solitaire specifically refers to peg solitaire. Both Solitaire and Patience are sometimes used to refer specifically to the Klondike form of Patience. The purpose of Patience generally involves manipulating a layout of cards with a goal of sorting them in some manner. It is possible to play the same games competitively (often a head to head race) and cooperatively. Patience games typically involve dealing cards from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on a tabletop, from which the player attempts to reorder the deck by suit and rank through a series of moves transferring cards from one place to another under prescribed restrictions. Some games allow for the reshuffling of the deck(s), and/or the placement of cards into new or \\\"empty\\\" locations. In the most familiar, general form of Patience, the object of the game is to build up four blocks of cards going from ace to king in each suit, taking cards from the layout if they appear on the table. There is a vast array of variations on the patience theme, using either one or more decks of cards, with rules of varying complexity and skill levels. Many of these have been converted to electronic form and are available as computer games. Examples of variants on the familiar Patience theme that may be played with an ordinary pack of cards include Bisley and Prince Albert. Basic forms of Klondike solitaire and FreeCell come with every version of Microsoft Windows from Windows 3.0 (though FreeCell was introduced in Windows 95) to Windows 7. Ever since the release of Windows 8, Windows Store offers six unique card games which can be downloaded for free from in the form of the Collection. There are also many applications for Android and iOS. History The game is most likely German or Scandinavian in origin.[1] The game became popular in France in the early 19th Century reaching England and America in the latter half. The earliest known recording of a game of patience occurred in 1783 in the German game anthology Das neue K\\u00f6nigliche L'Hombre-Spiel. Before this, there were no literary mentions of such games in large game compendiums such as Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester (1674) and Abb\\u00e9 Bellecour's Academie des Jeux (1674). Patience was first mentioned in literature shortly after cartomantic layouts were developed circa 1765, suggesting a connection between the two. This theory is supported by the name of the game in Danish and Norwegian, kabal(e). An 1895 account describes a variant of the game exclusively used for cartomancy.[1] The first collection of patience card games in the English language is attributed to Lady Adelaide Cadogan through her Illustrated Games of Patience, published in about 1870 and reprinted several times. Other collections quickly followed such as Patience by E. D. Cheney (1869), Amusement for Invalids by Annie B. Henshaw (1870), and later Dick's Games of Patience, published by Dick and Fitzgerald. Other books about patience written towards the end of the 19th century were by H. E. Jones (a.k.a. Cavendish), Angelo Lewis (a.k.a. Professor Hoffman), Basil Dalton, Ernest Bergholt, and Mary Whitmore Jones.
